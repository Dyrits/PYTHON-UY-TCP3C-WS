## -UDEMY- THE COMPLETE PYTHON 3 COURSE - BEGINNER TO ADVANCED! | WEB SCRAPER
Two WEB SCRAPERS have been made. 

The first one is giving back the results of a search using Bing in a very simple way. It is not always working properly, and I can't really figure out why. It is probably because the saved page is not fully loaded with the results.

The second one is saving all the images of a given webpage. I have an issue to add the extension for the format for each image, so the saved images are not getting any for now.

It is the first time I am using the different modules used for this project. It is more an experimentation than a concrete project.

### Status:  
In progress
